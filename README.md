# This project is a simple HTML page with a few images as resources.

## This project is used to illustrate Stash and Git concepts.

The images are free from rights illuminated texts from the French ["Bibliotheque Nationale"](http://www.enluminures.culture.fr/documentation/enlumine/fr/visites.htm)

The exercises consist in ordering the illuminated texts between 3 groups by editing the html file, using Git and Stash to share and merge the changes.
