## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to order the illuminated texts between 3 groups by editing the html file.

The 3 Groups are : **Peasants**, **Around the table**, and **At War**.


* You will just have to associate the correct city to its correct image.


* The images are all listed at the bottom of the file.


* Once you are happy with your changes, add the changes to the staging area.


* Commit, and push.


* Create a pull request to the main repository, to incorporate your changes.

The images are free from rights illuminated texts from the French ["Bibliotheque Nationale"](http://www.enluminures.culture.fr/documentation/enlumine/fr/visites.htm)
