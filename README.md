## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the **rebase** functionality of Git

* Some changes have been committed on `dev branch` since we created our branch.
We are ready to deliver our feature branch, therefore we need to update it in order to get those changes


* Our team policy recommends a clean history strategy and therefore encourages a rebase instead of a merge


* Rebase your work with regards to `dev branch`


* Make sure the commits on `dev branch` are the same and that you did not modify any public commits


* Inspect the commit with comment `setting up exercises's instructions` and compare its `$id` with the one of the person closest to you


* Are they the same ? Is it normal ?
