## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the **interactive rebase** functionality of Git

* I am working on my feature `interactive_rebase_hard` I am done with my work and I am ready to deliver my feature.


* Our team policy recommends a clean history strategy and I have been scolded by my git maintainer due to the content of my pull request: `git log -4 --oneline` outputs
> `f85c7ba` adding file5

> `34975c2` creating file2

> `a66aa79` pushing files 3 and 4

> `b9d7a89` adding file1


* The goal is to have a clean history for my pull request:
> `75eb3a4` adding files 4 and 5

> `fce7a7b` adding files 2 and 3

> `b9d7a89` adding file1


* To do so you will have to use the **interactive rebase**


* Use a set of interactive rebase actions to achieve a clean history
