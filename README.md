## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the **interactive staging** feature of GIT.

To do so, instead of having one single commit adding the whole solution, we want 3 commits:
1. One commit for `Peasants`
2. One commit for `Around the table`
3. One commit for `At War`


* Let's first revert to the previous commit, in order to edit it: `git reset HEAD~`


* Let's start the interactive staging script: `git add -i`


* Commit your work in order to have the desired history
