## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to solve merge issues through an external merge tool.


* To trigger the merge conflict, merge the `dev` branch into this branch.


* Get out of the merge conflict.


* Attempt to merge again.


* This time resolve the merge issues by getting rid of the `merge_conflicts.jpg` images.


* Commit the result.


* Undo the merge by rewriting the history as if the merge never happened.
