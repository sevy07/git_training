## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the **interactive rebase** functionality of Git, and most particularly with the pick and **fixup** features

* I am working on my feature `interactive_rebase_fixup` I am done with my work and I am ready to deliver my feature.


* Our team policy recommends a clean history strategy and I have been scolded by my git maintainer due to the content of my pull request: `git log -4 --oneline` outputs

> `f85c7ba` code review

> `34975c2` code review

> `a66aa79` implementing code review comments

> `b9d7a89` setting up exercise's instructions 


* The goal is to have a clean history for my pull request:

> `fce7a7b` implementing code review comments

> `b9d7a89` setting up exercise's instructions


* To do so you will have to use the **interactive rebase**


* Use a set of `pick` and `fixup` options to achieve a clean history in your pull request towards `master`
