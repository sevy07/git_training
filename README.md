## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to set up several remotes on the same repository, and share work between those remotes


* To start, clone this repository (if you haven't already done so), **we should be in your own personal fork**


* Add as a new remote **the person sitting next to you's fork** (he/she has to grant you read access first)


* Ask him/her to create a branch on his/her fork, checkout this branch in local


* Push to a branch with another name on your own fork


* Set this newly created branch to track your local branch


* Declare a new remote : `main_repo` from the london *main* fork `illuminated_texts_london`


* Fetch and checkout the newly created `test_remote_branch` branch from the main repository


* Are you in a `detached HEAD` state ? Why, what happened ?


* How do we fix that ?
