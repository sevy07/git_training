## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with the cherry-picking functionality of git.


* List all the commits that are present on branch `cherry-pick` but not on this branch


* Cherry pick, **in one single command** *ALL* the commits from `cherry-pick` branch that are not on this branch


* Inspect that no other commits were cherry-picked, and that you have the commit history needed: just the fixes, after the exercise description, in the correct order.
