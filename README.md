## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with git **Hooks**, and create your own hook.


* This exercise assumes you have Python installed on your machine

  To check, please run `python --version`, if it is not installed, it can be found [here](https://www.python.org/)
  
  The script requires Python `v2.x`


* To start, get the file `prepare-commit-msg.toEdit` and copy its content in your `prepare-commit-msg` file in your `.git\hooks` directory


* Check how it works by committing a dummy file


* Update the script so that when you are on a feature branch, the commit message would be: `Feature <branch_name>`


* Test it on a Feature branch 


* Update the script to remove the `_` characters from the branch title


* Update the script so that when you are on a bugfix branch, the commit message would be:  `Fix for <branch_name>`


* Test it on a bugfix branch


* Update the script to remove the `_` characters from the branch title
